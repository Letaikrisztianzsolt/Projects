So I started without knowing html, just using google sites:  https://sites.google.com/view/1lepes/f%C5%91oldal This lead you to this https://sites.google.com/view/2lepes/f≈ëoldal. Then it spits this out after converting the morse code to binary and the binary to text https://sites.google.com/view/acbdfe/f%C5%91oldal. You have to play to get your reward
Then, I used some of my brain to make a better version https://sites.google.com/scoalagasparandras.ro/boldogszulinapotjoel/f%C5%91oldal. 
    This one is actually using html, and is quite pretty but the problem was that google sites would not allow me to make even better and more complex versions, because i wanted to use some more advanced javascipt but it said that it is very dangerous
